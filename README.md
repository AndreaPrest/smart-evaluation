# Smart Evaluation 

## Intro
This is the project done by me for my master thesis. The aim of the project was to deliver a prototype for a system that could allow instructors to create admission tests and candidates to take the test. The main core of the project was to deliver questions skill-oriented. For example the questions related to the coding skill needs to be answered using actual code. 

## The applications
The application is composed by 2 Web Applications: 
1) **Instructors application**: This application is only used by the instructors and allow them to create and manage: questions,courses,topics,tests and so on.
2) **Candidate application**: This application is used by the candidates that, given a unique code, can access the test and take it.

## Technologies
- Vue.js
- Nuxt.js
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB

## Notes
Probably there are 1000 of bugs and errors, but the aim of the thesis was to provide a prototype....
